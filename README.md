# Malware detection
This study aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of malware detection with a hybrid approach that combines traditional machine learning algorithms with metaheuristic optimization. Initially, standard models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest were employed to classify malware, with Random Forest outperforming the others (94.35% accuracy). To improve this performance, the Random Forest model's hyperparameters were optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Simulated Annealing (SA).

### Optimization result
PSO: 94.22% accuracy
GA: 95.04% accuracy (Best performance)
SA: 94.70% accuracy

The GA-optimized Random Forest model surpassed the others, obtaining the maximum accuracy of 95.04%, demonstrating a robust and scalable method for real-time malware detection.
